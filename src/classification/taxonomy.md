# Taxonomy Guidance

- Use categories in `personal > memberships` for emails related to your participation in organizations, clubs, choirs, or other groups you are a member of. This includes surveys, planning, volunteer opportunities, and internal group communications that are not marketing or promotions.

- Use categories in `professional > memberships` for emails related to your participation in professional organizations, standards groups, industry committees, or similar bodies. This includes meeting notes, agendas, formal communications, and group coordination that are part of your professional identity but not direct work tasks or marketing.

- Use `personal > content_subscriptions` for emails related to your personal subscriptions to content creators, podcasts, newsletters, or similar services. This includes event announcements, content updates, and communications from creators that are not direct marketing or billing.
- Do not use this category for general marketing emails from platforms you are not subscribed to, or for transactional emails like receipts or billing notices.

- Use `important_and_urgent` only for emails that require immediate action or attention, such as deadlines, emergencies, or critical updates. Do not use this category for general announcements, scheduled events, or promotional content, even if they include dates or times, unless they explicitly state urgency or require a response.
