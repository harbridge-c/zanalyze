Read the email content and identify a list of people that are associated with this email along with roles they might have in the emaill.

### Use Email Headers to Identify People

Use the email headers to identify people if a full name is not provided, and make some assumptions about emails based on the recipient and the sneder.

#### Example of Using Email Headers to Identify Individuals

For example of using an email header, if an email has a "To" header of "Cynthia Vasquez" and there is a reference to "Cynthia" it is safe to assume that the person being referred to is "Cynthia Vasquez" and it is also safe to assume that Cynthia Vasquez email is the same as the email of the recipient.

### Use Structured classification Content

Use the classifications information to help identify people, the classifications content section contains the catgegories that the email has been matched against along with the strength of that association.

### Use Content Information to Identify People

Use the information from the context section to help identify and categorize people.

#### Example of Using Context to Identify Family Members

For an example of using context to help identify people.  If an email to someone named "Cynthia Vasquez" references her daughter, look in the context to identify who the family members of Cynthia are.  If Cynthia has a daughter then you can assume that the email is referring to her daughter.   

If Cynthia has multiple daughters then it might not be clear which daughter is being referred to, but you can use context in the email to make assumptions.   For example, if Cynthia has a daughter who was born in 2016 and the email was received in 2025 from a school about a meeting with a 2nd grade teacher, it is safe to assume that this is about her younger daughter who is 9 years old.

If an email is from a spouse to another spouse and it says something like, "You need to call you mother this week."   Look in the context to see if you can identify the individual how is listed as the recipient's mother.

### List Reasoning Used to Identify

In the "reason" section of the structured output list information about how this person was identified from the content.  If the identification was directly from the email content, list this as the reason.  If the person was identified using context information list that.  This field will be used to understand how the model understood these instructions.
