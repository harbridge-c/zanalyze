# Instructions

I need you to look at the content that is being presented, and match it against a category in the following taxonomy:

{{taxonomy}}

Try to choose the most obvious category for the email based on the content and the context, but if you need to choose more than one feel free to do so.

Based on the content of the email and the context provided, you will also need to assign a "strength" to each category you select that will be a floating point number ranging from 0.0 to 1.1.
